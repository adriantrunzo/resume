# My resume

I used to work on my resume in LaTeX and export it to a pdf. My resume, however, was the only reason I used LaTeX. Eventually, it seemed like a better idea to maintain the document in a technology I actually use more frequently. Thus, I converted it to just plain HTML and CSS, while keeping the same overall format of the original [LaTeX template](https://www.math.nyu.edu/student_resources/res.cls) I was using. I tried to keep the HTML as focused on content as possible, so the stylings make heavy use of selectors rather than classes. 

My goal was to export to pdf via the "Save to PDF" feature of a browser print dialog. That technique seems to work just fine. The page itself, though, is responsive and can be viewed just fine in the browser as well.
